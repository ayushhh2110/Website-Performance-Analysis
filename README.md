# Website-Performance-Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing end-to-end data analysis using Python. The objective was to work with a real-world dataset, understand the data structure, frame relevant analytical questions, and derive meaningful insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations.

The project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow commonly followed in Data Analyst and MIS roles.
